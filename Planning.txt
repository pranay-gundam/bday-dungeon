The game is a rpg dungeon crawl game that revolves around the main character navagating through 4 levels:
1. Originial Meeting
2. Memorable Moment 1
3. Memorable Moment 2
4. Final Boss = funny meme

The map layout is a simple cross shape as below where you spawn in the initial room that gives instructions about how to play the game and what is
going on and an initial happy bday message. Then you advance forward where random enemies will spawn.

There are two types of basic enemies:
1. Melee: just walks into you
2. Ranged: shoot one projectile every _ many seconds

Bosses each have a pattern of shooting projectiles where the final boss randomly chooses one of the patterns each attack.

At certain points in the game there will be collectibles and easter eggs that you will be able to see in you backpack each of which represent
some sort of connection to the bday boi.

Also in the beginning of the game you will get the choice of cutomizing your avatar.
